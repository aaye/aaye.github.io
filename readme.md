# About the author

**Andrew Aye** has been working in the game industry since March 2001. His responsibilities were first focused on creating significant game engine features (for example, a modern simulation on the PS2), evolving to create and modify all aspects of a game engine (real-time interactive). Along the way, he became responsible for growing other engineers and organizations. He always took a collaborative and partnership stance with cross-functional partners. The highlight (to date) of his career was owning the responsibility for leading and managing two Call of Duty projects (Modern Warfare 3 and Ghosts). In 2017 he transitioned into a traditional tech company (Amazon) and helped to bootstrap the Amazon Pharmacy project. In his role on the leadership team of North America Consumables, he helped navigate the pandemic for the engineering teams (remote work). He collaborated on creative solutions for the excessive demand placed on the amazon.com site.

He is currently taking a break and looking forward to his next challenge. It is an open question if this will be another role to feed, drive, and grow an organization or if he will dive back into code to drive impact for the next generation of real-time interactive software.
