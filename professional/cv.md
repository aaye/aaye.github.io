<div class="aaye-main-cv-content-title"><span class="content-title-h1"><span>Introduction</span></span></div>

**<span style="color:black">Andrew Aye</span>** has been working in the game industry since March 2001. His responsibilities were first focused on creating significant game engine features (for example, a modern simulation on the PS2), evolving to create and modify all aspects of a game engine (real-time interactive). Along the way, he became responsible for growing other engineers and organizations. He always took a collaborative stance with cross-functional partners. The highlight (to date) of his career was owning the responsibility for leading and managing two ***<span style="color:black">Call of Duty</span>*** projects (*Modern Warfare 3* and *Ghosts*). In 2017 he transitioned into a traditional tech company (Amazon) and helped to bootstrap the Amazon Pharmacy project. In his role on the leadership team of North America Consumables, he helped navigate the pandemic for the engineering teams (remote work). He collaborated on creative solutions for the excessive demand placed on the amazon.com site.

<div class="aaye-main-cv-content-title"><span class="content-title-h1"><span>Summary</span></span></div>

**<span style="color:black">Andrew Aye</span>** worked for 17 years in the video game industry, starting immediately after graduating from University. He graduated with degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science. In 2020 he completed a dual degree program and received Master of Business Administration degrees from Cornell University and Queens University. In the game industry, his first job was to help develop a video game engine to allow small games to be published on Real Arcade. Next, using his experience in Mechanical Engineering, he developed a robust and highly optimized physics simulation. Leveraging his knowledge as part of the core technology group, he created a new game engine focused on the tools and technologies explicitly needed for RPG developers. He spent a year with the incubation and pack-in launch title team for Kinect and, for the first time, had to fix issues within the Xbox operating system. The highlight of his time in the video game industry was taking charge of the engineering and project management for two Call of Duty projects. After a well-deserved break, he returned to Microsoft, working with the publishing and developer experience teams for the Xbox One X. He then decided to change industries. He went to Amazon to be the technical leader for North America Consumables leadership team. 

<br/>

**<span style="color:black">Andrew</span>** has had the privilege to work with many talented cross-function partners throughout his career. While working at Microsoft, he learned from *Andrew Goossen* about the history and future of DirectX development. While at Infinity Ward, he worked with *Jake Rowell* to develop the next-generation art pipeline for Call of Duty. He sparred with *Robert Field*, the lead engineer from the early days (before Activision's purchase) of the Infinity Ward Call of Duty code base. He learned the strict discipline required to develop an engine supporting a 60 FPS shooter. He worked closely with *Chris Avellone* on developing a new RPG experience. It is the personal experiences with his team and peers that he carries with him the most from his past experiences.
