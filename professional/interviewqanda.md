<span style="color:blue">How do you **motivate your team**?</span>  
- (Cribbing from Primed to Perform, and Creativity by Ed Catmull)  
  * Positive: <span style="color:orange">**Play**</span> (enjoy the work, fit), <span style="color:orange">**Purpose**</span> (value generation), <span style="color:orange">**Potential**</span> (future capability, growth)  
  * Negative: <span style="color:orange">**Inertia**</span>, <span style="color:orange">**Economics**</span>, <span style="color:orange">**Emotion**</span>  
- Set the bar (expectation), agree on goals - and clearly <span style="color:orange">**demonstrate trust**</span> that they will achieve it (Trust)  
- Clearly and authentically <span style="color:orange">**invest in their growth and improvement**</span> (EQ)  
- Connect the <span style="color:orange">**tactical**</span> work being done, to impact and business <span style="color:orange">**strategy**</span> (value generation)  
- Be available and support as needed

<br/>

<span style="color:blue">What **motivates you**?</span>  
- Seeing others develop and grow to be successful, in part due to my interventions and support.

<br/>

<span style="color:blue">What are your **personal strengths**?</span>  
- Flex between <span style="color:orange">**high-minded conceptual conceptual**</span> thinking and pragmatic <span style="color:orange">**execution**</span> mindsets  
- Analytical and <span style="color:orange">**problem-solving**</span> skills

<br/>

<span style="color:blue">Most **difficult feedback**?</span>  
- It <span style="color:orange">**challenges your self-image**</span>. I always work to convert this into a learning moment. 
- For example, I had feedback that people felt <span style="color:orange">**intimidated**</span> by me in group situations (design brainstorming sessions for example). I always saw myself as “<span style="color:orange">**one of the team**</span>”. However, that was not how the team felt. I learned to <span style="color:orange">**hold back**</span> and let the team always go first prior to providing feedback.  

<br/>

<span style="color:blue">What are your **blind spots**?</span>  
- My communication (or <span style="color:orange">**argument style**</span>) tends towards the <span style="color:orange">**analytical**</span> and away from the <span style="color:orange">**intuitive or emotional based**</span>. This is an area that I have to be aware, and work with others to make sure that everyone is validated and we have mechanisms to hear and listen to everyone’s communication style.

<br/>

<span style="color:blue">How do you **deal with conflict**?</span>  
- Situational - the desire is to strive for a <span style="color:orange">**win-win**</span>, which requires <span style="color:orange">**listening**</span> to and <span style="color:orange">**understanding**</span> the other point of view. 
- Need to have a backbone, and <span style="color:orange">**stand up**</span> for your team. 
- Need to <span style="color:orange">**accept an opposing decision**</span> and be able to move on as well. 
- In terms of specific steps, taking a step back and giving people time to cool down. Look at the communication, and see what type of <span style="color:orange">**communications gaps**</span> may be present (or assumptions made). 

<br/>

<span style="color:blue">Describe a few of your **peers** at your company and what type of **relationship** you have with each of them.</span>  
Initially, I would describe peers in three groups: <span style="color:orange">**reporting peers**</span> (sharing the same manager), <span style="color:orange">**role peers**</span> (people in the same role and level), and <span style="color:orange">**project peers**</span> (people with similar responsibility/accountability on a project). In the <span style="color:orange">**reporting**</span> space, my relationship was very much a <span style="color:orange">**consulting and inform**</span> role. I had regular 1:1s with all of them (monthly) to discuss business issues, changes to tech strategy, emergent issues outside of the team, internal sentiment of the tech team, technical goals, etc. <span style="color:orange">**role and project**</span> peers tend to be more of a <span style="color:orange">**responsible**</span> role - sharing of effort to achieve a goal.

<br/>

<span style="color:blue">What do **office politics** mean to you, and do you see politics as your job?</span>  
<span style="color:orange">**Office politics**</span> to me is a vague term with a <span style="color:orange">**negative connotation**</span> that is used in many situations to associate <span style="color:orange">**blame**</span> for a road block or failure. The primary drivers are natural outcomes of (1) the necessary <span style="color:orange">**human interaction**</span> and communication between teams (2) <span style="color:orange">**limited resources**</span> in the organization and a need to achieve a goal for which teams have <span style="color:orange">**different priorities**</span> (3) <span style="color:orange">**intentional bias**</span> of a team to optimize for the benefit of team’s perceived value (local optimization) rather than globally. The first two is natural and requires coaching to help improve outcomes. The third needs investigation as it is the corrosive (and truly negative) form of this phrase.  
My job is to engage and negotiate with teams to always strive for win-win situations.

<br/>

<span style="color:blue">How do you manage a **low performer**</span>  
- Provide (or make sure direct manager is) <span style="color:orange">**consistent critical feedback and clarify expectations**</span>  
- Check for <span style="color:orange">**externalities**</span> (personal, work fit, struggles)  
- Does the person need <span style="color:orange">**support**</span> (person), <span style="color:orange">**training**</span> (improvement)  
- Is the issue a bad fit - <span style="color:orange">**reposition**</span> in team or org, <span style="color:orange">**PIP and Term**</span>

<br/>

<span style="color:blue">How do you manage someone with **high potential**</span>  
- <span style="color:orange">**More engagement**</span> (invest the most in HIPO)  
- Provide <span style="color:orange">**growth opportunities**</span> and challenges  
- <span style="color:orange">**Actively work**</span> on growth plan and execution.

<br/>

<span style="color:blue">How do you **grow and develop** you team membrs.</span>  
- The plan is a <span style="color:orange">**collaboration**</span> between myself and the report. Understand <span style="color:orange">**their goals**</span>.  
- Compare <span style="color:orange">**ladder**</span>: <span style="color:orange">**gap**</span> plan, <span style="color:orange">**strength**</span> plan.  
- Look to <span style="color:orange">**coach**</span> (self-actualization) and <span style="color:orange">**mentor**</span>.  
- Want to see people <span style="color:orange">**challenge their comfort zone**</span>.

<br/>

<span style="color:blue">What is the **structure of your 1:1s**?</span>  
- <span style="color:orange">**Review**</span> any notes made between the last 1:1 and the current 1:1 prior to the start of the meeting (in some cases).  
- Start with a <span style="color:orange">**short synopsis of the last 1:1.**</span>   
- Address any <span style="color:orange">**tasks**</span> that were made to either of us as a result of the last 1:1  
- <span style="color:orange">**Mentoring and coaching**</span> - bring me <span style="color:orange">**one thing you struggled with**</span> within the last period.
  * Discussion of an <span style="color:orange">**architecture**</span> approach and issues with it. etc.  
  * With <span style="color:orange">**low performers, this will be the bulk of the meeting**</span>, for example reviewing the state of their PIP etc.  
  * Career Plan.  
  * Team issues and development.  
  * Process issues. 
- <span style="color:orange">**Unstructured Time**</span> (<span style="color:orange">**bulk for HIPO**</span>). Usually encourage questions about the <span style="color:orange">**bigger picture, strategy**</span>, things happening outside of the organization. Also a great opportunity for feedback for myself as well. 

<br/>

- Managing and <span style="color:orange">**synthesizing**</span> information for executives

- <span style="color:orange">**Autonomy and not abdication**</span>

<br/>

<span style="color:blue">What do you look for when **hiring** an engineer.</span>  
- Strong fundamentals, willingness to learn, desire to grow and learn, humility, behaviours and principles
