Work in Progress


Performance management at a company normally encompases two primary incentive systems. The first is a incentive-feedback loop for business value acruing productivity. The company wants to incentivize the employees to maximize the value of the company through their work. The second is the method for recognizing and rewarding an employee's growth in terms of business valued capabilities. These two systems both leverage total compensation as a principle reward mechanism. Some of the companies I have been at try hard to separate these two systems and allowed me to clearly understand the competing nature of them.

Productivity: In this context, let's define productivity as the amount of business value generated divided by the amount of time it took to generate it. An employee would be able to maximize their productivity by doing tasks that generate a maximum amount of value that they can execute in the minimal amount of time. They would be able to reduce their execution time through familiarity (institutional knolwedge) and repetition (execution of the same or similar task). 

Promotion: In most companies that I have worked, this system is meant to reward people who have grown their capabilities and skills so that they can take on additional responsibilites and increased impact through others. Care is taken to validate that the growth is fungible and not through increased institutional knowledge, which is not transferable to other areas of the business or technology stacks. This type of growth often requires an employee to take on tasks that are new to them and require discovery and learning.
