# Incentives - Behaviours - Culture
## Building a Framework

I will begin a series of posts that touch on team and organizational culture, desired behaviours in that culture, and the incentives that drive the observed behaviours. This specific linkage has dominated my philosophy for organization building and remediation. 

A fellow Principle Engineer at Amazon (he was in the Alexa organization and had come over from Valve) and I were discussing engineering quality, the evidence needed for a promotion, and the work that was rewarded in performance reviews when he mentioned that the resulting tension (and issues) that we were seeing was due to the incentive structure at the company. He followed it up with a comment that, as a gaming engineer, it was easy to see and understand how company incentives created perverse behaviours and undermined the desired company culture. I took a moment and thought about that statement. In creating video games, the team has to generate player incentives (some overt and others much less) to engage and move the player forward. Artists will light a set so that the player naturally focuses on level areas and places we want to draw their attention to. The lighting sequence will cause a player to move along a path set by the designers through a level. Game design systems create a reward loop to keep players engaged and improve their skills. A more extreme example of these game design loops can be seen in free-to-play games. We can create play-reward loops based on virtual goods that cause people to spend large amounts of money. Taking my experiences in these areas, I took a new look at the reward incentives at tech companies. After a few months of thinking (and reading), I developed the title mantra: incentives lead to behaviours that lead to culture. Work backwards through each step if there is an issue with your culture.

In 2019 in the middle of my MBA, the business class reviewed a similar case of incentives that built on these earlier insights. There was an area that was seeing a surge in the cobra population. The government wanted to address the issue and created a bounty on cobras to reduce their population. The result was that people started cobra farms to cash in on the bounty. The other problem this created was that escaping cobras (from the farms) resulted in a net increase in the number of snakes in the area. Therefore in business reviews, bad actors exploiting an incentive tend to be called "cobra farms."

We will begin with an assumption that for any incentive, there will be some number of people who will look to gamify it for their benefit. We will also assume that people will, on average, attempt to maximize their gain (benefit, growth, etc.) when selecting which incentives to follow.

## Example #1
### Work Hours, Unplanned

This example will focus on the case of the number of hours that an employee can self-select to execute outside of their regular paid time. I will assume for this case that people responsible for planning have yet to build in an expectation of extra work hours. While a familiar concept (with many articles written on this already), it serves to break into how an example-based approach will lead to the resulting framework.

The observed behaviour is that employees spend significant time working outside of paid hours. Some are working so many hours they are in danger of burning out. An employee that burns out and disengages from the company (either by quiet quitting or leaving the company) robs the organization of that person's productivity, creativity, and institutional knowledge. The company has claimed they support a healthy work-life balance, but we do not see that behaviour. What incentives could drive a behaviour contra to the desired, or does the incentive structure demonstrate that the company's genuine desire is to have free unpaid labour?

**Incentive #1:** Employees enjoy their job and want to keep doing the work. There is satisfaction and a positive hormonal response for doing something you enjoy and getting recognized for the result. Software engineers love solving problems and coding. They will naturally want to keep engaging in the work as it is a reward in itself, and for many, there is an immediate feedback loop when the changes go to a customer.

- **Gamification:** The above incentive is primarily personal and based on human biology. It is not strictly able to be gamified (assuming the company is not using illegal pharmaceuticals). This assumes that the measure is delivered results (features, tools, etc.). If the company attempts to use time measurements (amount of time spent in the office) then the methods to gamify the measure is obvious.

- **Issue and Control:** Like any addictive disorder, employees can crave the recognition and reward loop to the detriment of their health. 

**Incentive #2:** Doing more work leads to more experience in the field, potentially leading to more significant opportunities in the future. Building up more skills in your area of work and broadening your institutional expertise and understanding will make it easier for you to take on larger projects and drive more significant impact. The result is the likelihood of faster promotions and rewards.

- **Gamification:** The typical way to gamify this incentive is to spread yourself thin across as many work efforts as possible. It allows you to learn about many work streams concurrently while contributing little impact (effort) to each work stream. It makes it appear that you are driving more impact than in reality. If you do grow and learn through this process, it is essentially leeching off others. 

- **Issue and Control:** People who are driven and want to improve themselves are good for the company. However, if this extra work is rewarded the same as the regular paid hours, it creates a feedback loop that this is expected behaviour (since it is awarded). Without a mechanism to separate the regular paid work from work done for self-improvement, it will all be treated as the expected work to be done for the existing compensation. This incentive creates a potentially dangerous loop that also serves to feed into the issues of the following incentive.

**Incentive #3:** Doing work quicker will result in more work. Alternatively, work completed at a lower rate than the average rate of people at your level will result in a bad rating. Positive outliers can expect compensation rewards and negative outliers will likely be terminated.

- **Gamification:** The default way to gamify this incentive is to artificially inflate a task's perceived difficulty or level of effort. An employee can then claim to be working more hours than in reality. 

- **Issue and Control:** The control of this incentive is challenging as there is no non-invasive way to monitor an employee's actual number of work hours. The most common method is to use a group-based estimation process and then measure execution against the estimation. This process helps prevent skew in a task measure of difficulty and level of effort. The organization can limit how much extra work someone can be assigned by relying on estimates for planning.

## Incentive -> Behaviour -> Culture
All of these incentives can drive people to work extra hours. It will create a rising tide problem. As the number of people working outside of paid hours increases, the expected productivity bar for the given compensation level will also increase. Therefore, people looking to distinguish themselves will have to put in even more hours, resulting in another increase in the average (etc.). This incentive is how a company can create a culture where people are expected to spend most of their time working while claiming to support a healthy work/life balance. As long as there are no controls or caps on the positive feedback cycle for increased work, the company relies on known human behaviour to drive this cycle, as discussed above, to create its desired work-centric culture.
