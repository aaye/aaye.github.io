title: Professional Reading List
---
Not an exhaustive list, and starting from 2021 (my library is currently still packed in boxes). However, the following are the books that have managed to make an impact in the last year. I’ll add a few comments and thoughts to each one (edit: moved the comments to blog-like posts parallel to this page). Each is here because they added value to my thinking regarding my career, management and/or technology. In most books, I walked away with a few kernels that really resonated, and in some cases a few parts where I would truly argue with the author. Use your own judgement, and remember that we are in our jobs to help the people around us to deliver a product or service that should help our clients. We are here to support and build up the people around us.
